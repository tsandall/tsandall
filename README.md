### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Torin. I'm one of the co-creators of the [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) project.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working with [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), particularly non-web embeddings.
- ðŸ˜„ I've given a number of talks on OPA over the years. You can find slides on [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/presentations).
- ðŸ’¬ I'm always happy to help people get involved with OPA or just answer questions. You can reach me via e-mail or twitter.
